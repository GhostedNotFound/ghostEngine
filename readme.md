# Ghost Engine (0.3.0)

Ghost Engine is a somewhat lightweight engine that uses the LOVE framework, commonly used by Uncoded Studios to make game development easier.

## Installation

Put main.lua in a directory with a game.lua file, then run the directory via LOVE (or use your terminal to run LOVE in the directory.)

Example:

```bash
$ love Documents/MyGame/
```

## Usage

See wiki.

## Support

## License

This project uses the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license. Check the files for a license file if you downloaded it.

## Project Status

In development. I recommend you wait for the 1.0.0 release before using this engine, but that's just me.
